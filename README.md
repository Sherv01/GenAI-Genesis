# üåå 3Dreamify

**3Dreamify** is a dreamy, AI-powered web app that transforms images (and soon, text prompts) into beautiful 3D models. Built with a soft, sparkly, human-first interface and cutting-edge AI models like TripoSR and Google Imagen, 3Dreamify makes 3D creation feel magical, accessible, and empowering.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload if you make edits.  
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## üåà Project Vision

We built 3Dreamify to break down barriers between imagination and technology.  
We believe that 3D creation should be **beautiful, emotional, and available to everyone**‚Äînot just technical experts.  
By combining AI with soft design and joyful interactivity, we hope to make creativity feel more human.
